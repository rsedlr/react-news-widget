# Further changes

One change I would make would be to add in a "topic" filter. This would allow the user to pick from a list of topics located under the "News" title that would then filter articles by topic. This would be easily implemented with the current news API, as supports a topic keyword as part of its query. These topics could have a similar appearance to the news source tags, but in pink.

Other small changes:

- The article source tag should have a link to the source's home page.
- Make the boarder radius of the show more button match the dropdown.
- The show more button could turn into a "show less" button once clicked.
- Make the dropdown arrow is slightly shorter to match the brief document better.
- Make the article titles bold like in the brief document. The google font I have used doesn't seem to support bold.
